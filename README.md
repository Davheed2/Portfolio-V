# Portfolio
## Understanding the Concept
This is a personal porfolio showing the skills and experience of Victor. I made use of HTML, CSS,
javaScript and the tailwind CSS framework for the first time in the project which i found out 
was actually good. It made me write lesser CSS code although i faced a challenge implementing the 
tailwind responsive design.
## Summary
I hope to implement a backend code instead of the form Submit email service in the future for emailing 
for the contact section as this is just purely a frontend project.
