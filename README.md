# Portfolio
## Understanding the Concept
This is a personal porfolio showing the skills and experience of Victor. I made use of HTML, CSS,
javaScript and the tailwind CSS framework for the first time in the project which i found out 
was actually good. It made me write lesser CSS code although i faced challenges implementing the 
tailwind responsive design, hamburger menu for mobile and the image overlay icon for the project
section. I solved this by reading documentations which is the best, I would recommend W3 schools.
Image overlay -> https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_image_overlay.asp                     
Side Navbar -> https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_sidenav.asp
## Summary
I hope to implement a backend code instead of the form Submit email service in the future for emailing 
for the contact section as this is just purely a frontend project.
